# TaskList
MEI Development is a development group, we are a group of 13 year old developer who are middle school students, and we are making open source projects for everyone to enjoy. This is lisenced under Apache Open Source 2.0 license. 

**Languages**

__HTML__ HTML is the base for all our web applications. 

__CSS__ CSS is being used to style web applications. This may change soon since we may switch to .jsx react where we can do all the css in the react file. 

__Javascript__ Is the old language we used for v1 of LoginSystem, this has now been changed. 

__Typescript__ This is our current scripting language, and we have it precompiled into javascript. 

**Planned Apps**

__Login System__ LoginSystem is currently a work in progress open source login system that includes all backend code. 

__TaskList__ Tasklist will be a feature packed web based task manager, for your daily tasks. This will include text formatting features, and many things you can add to your task. A electron based web application of this will also come after the web release. The electron app version will be availible for windows and linux when it comes out. MacOS version may be delayed, until one of us gets a mac. Estimated releases date of the full feature packed version (after alpha and beta) is on December by Christmas (although this could change).

**About the Developers**

**Head Developer: Edward Lee** I am the one who wrote this readme, and I am the core contributor doing 90% of all code. I am a 13 year old, and I am currently attending middle school doing projects in my down time. I use html, css, sass(rarely), bootstrap(only for quick layouts), javascript(small projects), and typescript(larger projects).

**Front End Developer: Isaac** Another core developer, although he is currently busy at this time, and will help more when he has more time. He is also a 13 year old middle school student who sometimes codes in his free time.

**Backend Java Developer: Max ** Backend developer, hopefully we can make the backend of Login System using java, although we probably will switch to Node.js.
